# Platform DXC Solutioning Guidance
# Current Situation – September 2018



* In FY19, DXC managed service offerings will be integrated with Platform DXC and aligned to a unified DXC strategy. This **Dashboard Link** provides the onboarding status of DXC managed service offerings on to Platform DXC.

* Until alignment is complete, if a solution requires a "Hybrid" approach; Platform DXC has an integration engine, called **Service Ramp.** (Hybrid is defined as a mix of traditional (ES/CSC/Other) and new digital offerings.

  * Service Ramp is an ITSM interface which allows non-refactored offerings to use Incident, Request and Change Management using Platform DXC.  Facelift possible,

  * For more complex work, it will require Operations to "open & use" the legacy tooling to manage until replaced or refactored.  Hybrid solutions may also include client specific tooling.

* If a solution requires non-managed services (staff augmentation) or client specific tooling, which DXC would operate, operational approval is required from Offering Delivery & Transformation (OD&T).

* This Solution Guidance document is for Platform DXC regarding our managed service deals.

* This guidance has been approved by Greg Dietrich (OE&E) & Tim Henderson (AAE) and is effective immediately.

* Questions or feedback regarding this document can be sent to Dawn Dworsky (ddworsky@dxc.com)

| • Platform DXC is optimized for DXC’s delivery to drive productivity and automation via Bionix<br/>• Clients consuming DXC managed services who choose not to invest in an integrated SM solution can submit a request, report an incident, or review status of services provided by DXC. A client may participate in a workflow (e.g., an approval) within the Enterprise ITSM portion of Platform DXC | • We recommend the use of Platform DXC standard tooling for the services being delivered for the client to maximize cost and efficiencies. However, as Platform DXC is modular it also has the capability to accommodate client specific tooling and integrate it into the DXC framework. These would be custom integrations and require support from Solution Assurance to ensure the complexity and touchpoints are understood and documented within the solution and the bid<br/>• It is standard to set up clients with Portal access and cost request catalogue creation<br/>• It is standard to set up clients with Portal access to submit a request, report an incident or review the status of services provided by DXC<br/>• Specific client tooling can be accommodated and integrated into the Platform DXC modular framework. Typically you see this requirement to achieve a client's unique business requirement/ capability/ outcome vs. tooling for basic IT health management. The former is the power of the modularity, the second in most cases adds complexity and cost. It can be accommodated, but needs to be tested with OE&E for value before proceeding. |

**2. Sales Ready - Client wants DXC to work directly in their ITSM Tooling**

Description
The client requires DXC operations work from within their ITSM tooling as the performing supplier of services

| • The SIAM platform is not part of the offering and will require a partner to provide SIAM service e.g. ServiceNow through DXC Fruition Partners <br/>• Clients MUST buy the DXC SIAM managed service in order to use the SIAM module which is based on ServiceNow, where ServiceNow is the customer’s SIAM Platform of choice.<br/>• The SIAM Module is DXC’s tooling that enables DXC as the service integrator to perform our function more efficiently through automation. <br/>• DXC as a SIAM provider can include the module as part of the SIAM scope of service. The module cannot be sold separately.<br/>• DXC as a service provider will work out of Platform DXC and must be integrated with the client tool | • All SIAM deals MUST work with the SIAM offering team, Amanda Roberts is the DXC offering manager, to ensure they sell the DXC SIAM services <br/>• Where ServiceNow is the customer SIAM Platform preference and they are requesting a partner to deploy, then engage with DXC Fruition Partners. They will provide the solutions and costs to develop the platform and provide, run, and maintain services to the client as part of the joint DXC proposal. It will not be provided by the standard DXC operational development and support organization<br/>• Fruition will need to engage with DXC for the development of standard integrations with Platform DXC for the scope of performing supplier services.<br/>• DXC delivery will not work in the client’s SIAM tool as it minimizes the value of our offerings as we have no control over the architecture and design and are unable to take full advantage of the efficiencies or value streams Bionix brings |

**5. OE&E Support - Client wants to use Platform DXC for retained support**

#  Which Platform DXC Instance to use?

Platform DXC is available on the **Global Commercial environment,** located in Europe (data center pairing of UK and Netherlands).

The **Global Commercial instance is the most cost effective** with the broadest support and delivery network with all the components of Platform DXC.

**Additional capabilities exist for government and geographical restriction**with documented restrictions.

* Made available upon demand

* Additional time is required to stand up these environments; therefore engage early with Solution Assurance

* Client may need to pay for the cost of standing up a new secured instance of Platform DXC in the restricted region/ country if a secured instance does not exist and are available

* Refer to this link for more details. Keep in mind all components of the solution will need to meet stated restrictions.

# Integration Guidance

## Integration Guidance – Client ITSM


**Platform DXC enables integration between a Client ITSM system and DXC ServiceNow via eBonds.** eBond is the term used to describe the external client ITSM solutions DXC and a third-party (Customer or Partner) use to support the IT Service Management operating model. Full details are available at this link - https://github.dxc.com/pages/Platform-DXC/integration-ebond/std-ebond/strategic/. Updates will be made when new capabilities become available.

When a solution includes integrations to client tools, be considerate of:

* The **definition of a standard eBond** is when the Client ITSM system adheres 100% to the DXC Integration Specification.  Any deviation from this standard automatically implies a custom integration with associated increase in cost and duration.  Additionally, any deviation from standard found during implementation requires a change order to be raised with program governance to address any contractual, financial, or timeline adjustments.

* **Number of integrations** - the more integrations required, the more cost needs to be included in the deal and time needs to be added for transition and deployment.  Many times the client will be resource constrained and cannot deploy multiple integrations in parallel.

* **Complexity** - Platform DXC is modular and has many integration points outside of traditional ITSM eBonds. Therefore any other integrations outside of eBonds or to client specific tooling will be custom integrations (e.g. Events, Asset, Knowledge, Automation)

* **Required instance (Commercial / Domestic / Secure)** – resource availability and costs to implement eBonds are different based on location.

Platform DXC eBonds support the following business processes and types:

| eBond type | Incident | Request | Change | Problem | CI |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|---------|----|
| Standard   | √        | √       | √      | √       |    |
| Custom     |          |         |        |         | √  |


**Please note: Epicon Integration Bus** is NOT the DXC standard for ticket exchange between a client and DXC.  Its usage by a client or DXC offering could be considered a standard integration if the DXC Integration Specification is adhered to by the party implementing Epicon.  If in doubt, solution a custom integration.


## Integration Guidance - DXC ServiceRamp

ServiceRamp is an Integration Configurator tool that allows Onboarding and Operations teams to configure and publish integrations in a codeless fashion.  Using pre-defined templates build upon the DXC Integration Standards, ServiceRamp accelerates the integration process by using a graphical user interface to define the endpoint systems, their protocols, credentials, and the desired integration types.  

ServiceRamp publishes its configuration files to the Platform DXC run time engines that execute the eBond transactions.  These configuration files instruct the run time engines to perform actions such as routing, data transformation, and process flow between Client and DXC systems.  

ServiceRamp is in production and can be used to provision Platform DXC Incident eBond integrations to the Global Commercial instance of DXC Service Now.  Service Request and Change eBond integrations will be available Q4FY19.  Once ServiceRamp and associated eBond integrations have been deployed in a Platform DXC region, the current point-to-point integrations to ServiceNow through ConnectNow will be prohibited.  Any deal that requires an eBond outside of a ServicRamp enabled region should be solutioned with the current heritage ConnectNow integration capability. This is an interim solution to support deal processing whilst the Offerings are refactored into Platform DXC natively.

The cost and solution designs are still being worked through. In the meantime continue to solution with the ebonds as they are defined, including the legacy CSC cost models for integrations and engage with Solution Assurance to provide additional guidance.

In summary, three key points:
*	ServiceRamp is in production and can be used to provision Platform DXC Incident eBond integrations to the Global Commercial instance of ServiceNow.  Service Request and Change eBond integrations will be available Q4FY19
*	Solution heritage ServiceNow / ConnectNow if integration is required in any region where Platform DXC is not deployed
*	Any Platform DXC integration deal requires Solution Assurance guidance before proceeding.



## “Hybrid” Integration Guidance

"Hybrid" meaning a mix of traditional (ES/CSC/Other) and new digital offerings. Platform DXC is developing an integration engine, called ServiceRamp (see previous slide on “Integration Guidance - DXC ServiceRamp” for description).

ServiceRamp will enable intra-company integration of any heritage ITSM tool, including Service Manager, BMC Remedy, or any other heritage ITSM tool requiring integration to DXC ServiceNow.

This will allow the DXC Operations team for offerings not yet onboarded on Platform DXC to execute the Incident, Request and Change within Platform DXC ServiceNow. While more complex work may still require Operations to "open & use" the legacy tooling to manage until the Offering is replaced or refactored (for example Availability / Capacity).

The replacement option for DRA which has been withdrawn will need to consist of a custom solution and cost. This will need to include:

* Incident, Request and Change will be handled by ServiceRamp
* For CI - Include a custom API development cost of $25k
* All other integrations (SCCM, AD etc.) will require the current integration model and cost as defined in the integrations register

All solutions which include ServiceRamp will work with Solution Assurance until a standard model is available



# Platform DXC Capabilities, Tools and Interface Mapping by Offering

This table provides Platform DXC pillar, capability provided by pillar and offering which consumes that capability with high level solutoin  (i.e. tools  and interfaces required to deliver and support that capability). **The details mentioned in the table is not accurate and still work in progress**

# Deal Scenarios

## How to Solution Deals

Scope – Please refer to Platform DXC Capabilities, Tools and Interface Mapping slides for all the offerings* in scope.

All other offerings not included in this embedded excel file will be included when those offerings start onboarding onto Platform DXC. Any other offerings included within the client deal need to be evaluated on a case by case basis.

It provides the Solutioning team with the defined DXC strategic direction on how to sell and position the offerings for a given deal based on three deal scenarios:
1.	New Logo
2.	Contract Renewal
3.	Contract Add-on

Objective – Solution team to deliver consistent deal solutions aligned with this document guidance and DXC strategic direction.

Embedded excel file contains offering which are in the pipeline to be onboarded on Platform DXC and are approved for inclusion within solutions


## Deal Scenarios summary

Below are the three common deal scenarios to be used by the Solution teams when creating solutions for client deals. These scenarios provide defined Solution Guidance/Recommendations to ensure we can deliver what we sell.

| Scenario            | Description                                                                                                               | Implications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. New Logo Client  | Client is new to DXC and wants to consume DXC offerings                                                                   | • The future mode of operating is with Platform DXC and should be used as the default, unless there is a very strong justification for SRA<br/>• Consider the length of the contract and the implications of using legacy ITSM tooling like SRA as a delivery tool.                      |
| 2. Contract Renewal | Client already consumes offerings from h-CSC or h-ES and wants to renew these services                                    | • Remaining on legacy solutions impacts DXC’s ability to move to the future mode of operations<br/>• If the renewal is for two years or more, then look at the options to transform / modernize the existing services into next generation offerings and ITSM tooling using Platform DXC |

However, if it is secured or domestic instance then we need to have additional cost for the platform on case by case basis |

| Yes, until there is change in operating model and cross offering OSA will be also engaged along with other offering OSAWhat is the guidance if deal team wants to include LUCE  tool  ( part of UXC/RedRock offering)  for SLMS instead of Flexera?	Offering (e.g. W&M in this case) need to work with their management and discuss in their governance body. Cross offering OSA should support where required in the discussions.Do we need to understand solution if cost is taken care by other offerings OSA and vice versa (e.g.  Do we need to understand cost  if solution is taken care by other offerings OSA)?	We need to have holistic solution overview which depicts all the Platform DXC capabilities consumed by all the in-scope offeringsWhat do we do if  deal team says R&M ITIL resource cost is provided by other offering (e.g. NHIPS deal  application management offering said they will provide R&M resources)  and not by Service Management delivery team (e.g. Tom Fentres)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| All the details mentioned on GitHub is not GA (i.e. generally available). Contact Solution Assurance team and Refer to Solutioning Guidance Do we use SericeNow Service Proivder domain for offerings which are sold aaS (as a Service)?	It may vary offering to offeringWhat if cross-offering OSA is not sure about solution for some of the offerings and related cost (e.g. how mobile management, Virtual Desktop serivce  is provided as part of W&M offering:  do we need Airwatch to ServiceNow interface, MSVMC offering, MCPAAS offering)?	Offering OSA are equally accountable to provide the solution clarity.

Link for  Bionix assetsWhere can one find resource location both for onboarding and R&M ?	??? Refer to WorkplacementGuidelines -PDXC-31Aug2018.xlsx???What is the guidance to provide Platform DXC based solution where we don't have (or have any plan)  the Platfrom DXC instance  ?	Regional delivery leadership need to create business case Will there be any run and maintain cost for interfaces? If yes, what is the guidance around it ? Who owns it ?	There is no R&M cost for the interfaces which we need to account forWhatif only offerings such as AWS, Azure are in scope - are we fine to create limited number of client users (e.g. up to 20 which need to be decide) in ServiceNow instestead of mandating SSO (i.e. integrating ServiceNow with client AD)?	We can allow creating client users in ServiceNow  if it is less then ??? 100 ??? |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
